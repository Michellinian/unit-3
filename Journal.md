### Class 1 (2020/01/29)

We started unit 3 in this class. In unit 3, we will be using python as our primary programming language. First we started off with thinking about what features we would want if we were to create a programming language. Then we took a look at how python does all of that, and there was a bit of explanation about the syntaxes. It was very different from arduino/standard c. It was more close to bash, syntax wise, since no brackets are necessary. Python offers us very simple syntax. For example, when declaring variables, developers don't have to type the data type. It just automatically reads what data type it is. After learning these syntaxes, we started coding some basic programs. First we created the Hello World program, and then we started using control structures such as for loops and if statements. We were left with the task of Bubble sort, which is an algorithm that compares two numbers inside the list and swithcing the orders from small to big. I am still continuing on doing this task.


### Class 2 (2020/02/05)

Today we started off by checking the weekend task. Then we learned about CTS, or computational thinking skills. This skill has four steps, according to the video we watched today: 1. Decomposition 2. Pattern recognition 3. Abstraction 4. Algorithmic thining. In the first step, we  break the question into smaller questions, smaller steps. And then we deduce a pattern in the problem. For example, one can guess how the question can be solved, because of similar questions being asked in the past. This is pattern recognition. Then third, abstraction is about only focusing on the things that actually matter. Finally you deduce the steps to achieve the goal you want. This whole process is called the computational thining skill. After learning this, by using the skill, we developed a program in python with the prompt "From the 10 integers input by the user, find the largest prime factor". By using the computational thinking skill, we broke down the question, and looked at the problem step by step. Then after we have done that, we started a new task of creating inventory. I would need to create an inventory list for Lauricenia's book, and will be working on that nest class.
