### Class 1 (2020/01/29)

We started unit 3 in this class. In unit 3, we will be using python as our primary programming language. First we started off with thinking about what features we would want if we were to create a programming language. Then we took a look at how python does all of that, and there was a bit of explanation about the syntaxes. It was very different from arduino/standard c. It was more close to bash, syntax wise, since no brackets are necessary. Python offers us very simple syntax. For example, when declaring variables, developers don't have to type the data type. It just automatically reads what data type it is. After learning these syntaxes, we started coding some basic programs. First we created the Hello World program, and then we started using control structures such as for loops and if statements. We were left with the task of Bubble sort, which is an algorithm that compares two numbers inside the list and swithcing the orders from small to big. I am still continuing on doing this task.
