# TELOS feasibility study of Inventory development

### Technical 
**Is the project technically possible?**

The inventory that is required from the client is technical possible. What I mean by this is that, the program can be developed by the knowledge that I already have, and with the equipments that already exists. The success criteria of the program, updated on the other md file, is all possible with python and things we've learned during class. Furthermore the onky tool we are using to develop the program is the python IDE, aka PyCharm, therefore making the program techinally possible to be developed.

### Economic
**Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?**

This time, I won't be considering the second question, since this program is not developed to increase profit, but to achieve convenience for our client. The project will not cost any money to be built, since mentioned, the only tool necessary is the IDE, and information from the client on how they want the inventory system to look like and so on. 

### Legal
**Is the project legal?**

The project is legal. This project does not contain form of law violation. 

### Operational 
**How will the current operations support the change?**

This program is operational, although the client would be required to know how to use the app, as well as how to operate it. This is going to be a new system for the user, therefore they would be required a bit of time to get used to the system. Although this shouldn't be a big problem, since the client and I would be developing the system together, meaning that I would be getting feedbacks while developing the program. The user should have a good idea by the time I introduce my final product to my client. It might not be operational for client who are impaired in sensitivity for example eye sight since the program input would be the keyboard, although for now I am focusing on my client herself. From the reasons abpove, the program is fully operational for my client.

### Scheduling
**Can the project be done in time?**

This proejct would be done by the time my client would be needing it, which is this year's summer. She needs a packing list for summer, and I would have to hand in the final product by then, or even before, which is an achievable goal. Therefore this program also passes the scheduling feasiblity.
