## Answer to the Syllabus question


### You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and Explain how they work as a system to create a computer.

Parts: 
1. Motherboard
2. CPU
3. Storage Device (SSD)
4. RAM
5. Cooling 
6. monitor (output devices)
7. GPU
8. OS (operation system)
9. keyboard / mouse (input devices)

The first component of a copmuter is a motherboard. This is the biggest component in the computer structure, and this board is going to be connected to all the other essential parts of the computer. The next compenet is the CPU. CPU is the core processing unit and and every programs are ran through this processing unit, as well as all the calculations needed to execute the program. Therefore I would want to buy a really fast CPU. Also we would need a RAM, and this has the function of temporarily storing memories. This means that once the device is turned off, the RAM would become empty. Therefore we would also need a system that can store data even when the device is turned off. This is the SSD's role. This can keep our data safe even when the power is off. There are also hard drive disks that does the exact same function. Additionally I may also buy a GPU which is a processing unit that performs any type of calculations related to the visuals. These components, the SSD, RAM GPU, and the CPU, they would all be connected to the motherboard to perform any actions. Also a cooling system is needed to prevent the device from overheating. Operation system is something that we also need to install to our computer to get it function. The computer would be able to still turn themselves on, although without the OS it wouldn't know how to function. Finally I would also an input and output devices so that I can enter information and data to the computer and see the outcome.
