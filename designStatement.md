# As a client 


At the moment I have too many shorts in my room. I have never counted the number of shorts I have, and I feel like I lost some of my shorts, but I cannot tell which shorts I lost, because I haven't kept track of them. I would like an inventory where it helps me keep track of the shorts I have. I want the inventory to be editable, so that I can update the list whenever I lose one or buy a new one. There are different uses of shorts, such as for sport, for sleeping, and for going out. They can differ in materials such as polyester, cotton and nylon, and they all have different colors, from blue, black, brown and so on. I would also like to record these informations too. Lastly I want the system to be only assessed by me.
