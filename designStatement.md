# As a client 

At the moment I have too many shorts in my room, and to be honest I don't know how many nor what kind of shorts I have. One problem with this is that when I lose shorts, I always have trouble determining which shorts I've lost, because I haven't kept track on how many shorts I have. I want a system where I can see what kind of shorts I have for how many, and I want the system to be editable so that in case when I lose them, or when I buy a new one, I can update the system with new information. There are also information that I would like to keep track on, for example the materials of shorts, as well as the makers. I would also like to record the color of the shorts, and what use is it for, for example sports or pajamas, etc. Lastly I want the system to be only assessed by me.

I will be designing the Packing list inventory for Lauricenia. This inventory will record her properties, so that her packing process for summer will be smooth. It will make sure that she has veverything she needs for her summer holidays, and it also helps her keep track on how much things she has to bring back home, so that she can make it quick decision of buying a new luggage or not. This inventory will have categories and subcategories for her properties, and a space for description. It also needs to be editable so that she can change the categories, whenever she feels the need to.
