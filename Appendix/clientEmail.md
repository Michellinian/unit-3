Dear Arata,

Summer holidays start in a few months and I am starting to think of the packing process since I am going back home. I have been really worried I end up forgetting something important or that the number of things I have will not fit my bag and I may need to buy new luggage. For this reason, I need an inventory that will allow me to record the things that I have at the moment until the time when I start packing. This inventory needs to be divided into categories of type of items and its subtypes and must have a space for description, for example, the category clothes must have the subcategory of blouses and space where I can make a short description, eg: white with blue flowers. The things I have may vary a lot so I must be able to add any new category or subcategory to the system when I feel like the existing ones don’t categorize the item I need to add to the inventory.

If you have any doubts regarding the requirements, don't hesitate to contact me ( or just talk to me when you find me ). Thank you for offering your services!

kind regards,
Lauricénia Buque
